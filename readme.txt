Displays a progress bar for your fetus.

== Description ==
Displays a progress bar for your fetus.

As the birth of my son, Ian, quickly progressed, the metaphor of a progress bar seemed all too appropriate. Thus I began work on the Baby Loader, a simple JavaScript to show to the world just how long before your little one shows up to change your life.

This Wordpress widget lets you share your progress with the world. Give it a title, due date, and gender, and it gives you a progress bar, showing just how much longer you can expect your little bundle of joy.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
